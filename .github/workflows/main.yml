# GitHub Actions Workflow is created for testing and preparing the plugin release in the following steps:
# - validate Gradle Wrapper,
# - run 'test' and 'verifyPlugin' tasks,
# - run Qodana inspections,
# - run 'buildPlugin' task and prepare artifact for the further tests,
# - run 'runPluginVerifier' task,
# - create a draft release.
#
# Workflow is triggered on push and pull_request events.
